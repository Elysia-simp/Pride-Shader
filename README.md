# Prerequisites
1) obviously a way to decrypt/rip the game
2) models exported with [minmode's PMX noesis script](https://www.deviantart.com/minmode/art/Update-1-6-Noesis-PMX-VMD-export-809252773)
3) some brain power

# Rules

Albiet basic rules please follow them

1) Please credit me as either Chips, Chi, Chizukimo (don't care they're all me)

2) Please do not use anything here for commercial profit

3) You are allowed to modify this shader to your hearts content

4) You may distribute the edited Material.fx file for convenience but if you didn't edit the main shader (shader.fxh/sub folder) Please link to here instead

5) I am not responsible for the damage one may cause with this shader

6) Finally Please do not use this for R-18 related content

(like please they're all minors and one of them is dead)

# Usage

Set your Def texture in the Spheremap slot and your Sdw in the Toon slot

Now set your Materials as such

SubTex for anything that isn't a Face mesh and you can do Add or Multi for anything that is a face (leaving it disabled will make mmd ignore it entirely)

use photoshop with nvidia tools to make any Cubemaps you might need (you can also use any external programs I haven't really tested much)

then just duplicate Material.fx and just give it the proper names

if you want self shadow load HgShadow (I'm not using mmd's default shadowmap)

that should be it really just report any bugs/errors I've made

Errors related to normals cannot be fixed at this time due to asset studio's lack of tagent export

also asset ripper does not work with this game
