# Prerequisites
1) obviously a way to decrypt/rip the game
2) models exported with minmode's PMX noesis script
3) some brain power

#Usage

Set your Def texture in the Material slot and your Sdw in the Toon slot

Now set your Materials as such

SubTex for anything that isn't a Face mesh and you can do Add or Multi for anything that is a face (leaving it disabled will make mmd ignore it entirely)

Finally use photoshop with nvidia tools to make any Cubemaps you might need (you can also use any external programs I haven't really tested much)

finally just duplicate Material.fx and just give it the proper names

that should be it really just report any bugs/errors I've made
